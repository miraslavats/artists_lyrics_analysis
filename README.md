The models I've discussed and implemented in this project are Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, LSTM, Transfer Learning (USE), and LDA topic modeling

In this project, I am answering the question whether music artists sing about the same things nowadays. I am exploring this question by utilising the lyrics of Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Olivia Rodrigo, and Burna Boy. Burna Boy was included in the mix of pop singers for a baseline comparison, since I believe it should be relatively easy for the models to pick up on the differnces between him and the rest of the presented artists. This project has the following structure:

Data discussion;
Data cleaning + Explaratory Data Analysis;
Mathematical and intuitive explanations of models used for the task;
Model implementations;
Performance metrics and visualisations for every model;
Discussion + summary.

The models I've discussed and implemented are Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, LSTM, Transfer Learning (USE), and LDA topic modeling. All the predictive models perfgormed quite well with an accuracy score of > 60%. However, logistic regression achieved the highest accuracy:
